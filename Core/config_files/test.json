    "comment": "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are commonly used in game development for various purposes 
     due to their lightweight and easy-to-read format. They can be used to store game configuration settings, 
     level data, character attributes, and other game-related information. JSON files are particularly useful for 
     storing game saves and settings because they allow for structured data storage that can be easily parsed and 
     manipulated by the game engine. By using JSON files, developers can ensure that game data is organized and 
     accessible, making it easier to load and save game states, as well as to modify game settings without requiring 
     recompilation of the game code."
