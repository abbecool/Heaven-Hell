# TODO: Next Steps for Game Development

## :rocket: High Priority

### Player swimming animations
- **Draw new swimming animations for the player**

### Manage child entities using masks similarly to collision layers
- **Each entity has a childMask that stores which childern the entitie has.**
- **Access the childern using a vector storing the childIDs in the same order as the mask bitset. Thus the correct child can always be found**
- **Update the child mask and ID vector dynamically to stay up-to-date**

### More attacks
- **Different attacks for the rooter and goblin**
  - Goblin uses normal melee attacks
  - Rooter throws sticks until they run out. When empty the stick regenerate
- **Player can pick up a sword that can be swinged for melee damage**  
  - Draw/animate the sword
  - Add the sword to the game
  - Implement the swinging mechanincs using rendering angle
