# Heaven-Hell
My first attempt at creating a C++ game from scratch
-----------------------------------------------------
In this game you control two players, an angel and the devil. 
The objective of the game is to get both players to their respective goals/gates.
The catch is that the angel and devil are controlled by the same keys on the keyboard.
Get both to their goals without them getting stuck or dying.

# Heaven-Hell 2
This version of the game is a top-down RPG 
-----------------------------------------------------
Here you play as a XXX who is in charge of deciding who gets to go to heaven and who goes to hell (Sk√§rselden)
You dont know you origins and it is a mystery. There has been a greate battle and the starting area is in ruins.
Your quest is to find out about you origin/backstory.

Add trees, chop down a tree leaving a tree stump, cast a spell/potion on the tree stump to turn it into a rooter!
Spells primaraly deal damage and Potions primaraly inflict status effects.

Add the ability climb trees to see further
