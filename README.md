<!-- # Heaven-Hell
My first attempt at creating a C++ game from scratch
-----------------------------------------------------
In this game you control two players, an angel and the devil. 
The objective of the game is to get both players to their respective goals/gates.
The catch is that the angel and devil are controlled by the same keys on the keyboard.
Get both to their goals without them getting stuck or dying. -->

# Heaven-Hell
This version of the game is a top-down RPG 
-----------------------------------------------------
Here you play as a XXX who is in charge of deciding who gets to go to heaven and who goes to hell (Sk√§rselden)
You dont know you origins and it is a mystery. There has been a greate battle and the starting area is in ruins.
Your quest is to find out about you origin/backstory.

Add trees, chop down a tree leaving a tree stump, cast a spell/potion on the tree stump to turn it into a rooter!
Spells primaraly deal damage and Potions primaraly inflict status effects.

Add the ability climb trees to see further

# Developer Setup
Install MSYS2 installer (C++ compiler) by clicking the link: https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2024-12-08/msys2-x86_64-20241208.exe. Make sure the compiler is installed at this location: "C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/gcc.exe", otherwise c_cpp_properties.json needs to be adjusted. 

General Visual Studio Code setup guide can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

Install CMake (Windows x64 Installer): https://cmake.org/download/

Download and extract relevant SDL2 dependancies to sibling folder named "SDL2" and extract VC download inside.

## SDL2 Downloads

| SDL version            | File to download | Link |
|------------------------|:----------------:|:------------------:|
| SDL2              | SDL2-devel-2.32.8-VC.zip  | https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases       |
| SDL2_image    | SDL2_image-devel-2.8.8-VC.zip     | https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases  |
| SDL2_ttf         | SDL2_ttf-devel-2.24.0-VC.zip      | https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases       |
| SDL2_mixer              | SDL2_mixer-devel-2.8.1-VC.zip      | https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases  |

The SDL2 folder should look like this.

![](SDL2_folder.png)

When the sibling SDL2 folder is done, open the terminal in VSCode and then, inside the root directory of the repository run these commands:

```sh
mkdir build
```

this creates the build folder that CMake will use to build the project. Then initilize the build using the CMake commande:
```sh
cmake -S .   -B build/
```

Then select configuration inside of VSCode and press F5 to do an initial build/compile and then run the game.

To manually compile either the release or debug versions, run these commands:
```sh
cmake --build build --config release
```
```sh
cmake --build build --config debug
```
